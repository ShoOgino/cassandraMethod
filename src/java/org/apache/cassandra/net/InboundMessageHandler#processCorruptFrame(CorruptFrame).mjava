     *    impossible to skip the message safely

     *  - any self-contained frame with a corrupt payload (but not header): we lose all the messages in the
     *    frame, but that has no effect on subsequent ones
     *  - any non-first payload-corrupt frame of a large message: we know the size of the large message in
     *    flight, so we just skip frames until we've seen all its bytes; we only lose the large message
