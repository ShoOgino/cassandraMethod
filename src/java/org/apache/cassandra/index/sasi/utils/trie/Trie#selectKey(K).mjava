     * Returns the key that is closest in a bitwise XOR metric to the

     * For example, given the keys:
     *
     * <ol>
     * <li>D = 1000100
     * <li>H = 1001000
     * <li>L = 1001100

     * If the {@link Trie} contained 'H' and 'L', a lookup of 'D' would
     * return 'L', because the XOR distance between D &amp; L is smaller
     * than the XOR distance between D &amp; H.

     * @return The key that is closest in a bitwise XOR metric to the provided key.
