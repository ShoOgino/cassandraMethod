         * {@link org.apache.cassandra.transport.messages.AuthSuccess} message. If the negotiation is not yet complete,
         * the byte[] is returned to the client as a further challenge in an
         * {@link org.apache.cassandra.transport.messages.AuthChallenge} message. This continues until the negotiation
         * does complete or an error is encountered.
