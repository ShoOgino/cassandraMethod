     * First, bring one or more nodes up. Then run ClientOnlyExample with these VM arguments:

     Pass "write" or "read" into the program to exercise the various methods.

     Caveats:

     1.  Much of cassandra is not reentrant.  That is, you can't spin a client up, down, then back up in the same jvm.
     2.  Because of the above, you still need to force-quit the process. StorageService.stopClient() doesn't (can't)
         spin everything down.
