            Take the example from the unit test, and say your index looks like this:
            [0..5][10..15][20..25]
            and you look for the slice [13..17].

            When doing forward slice, we are doing a binary search comparing 13 (the start of the query)
            to the lastName part of the index slot. You'll end up with the "first" slot, going from left to right,
            that may contain the start.

            When doing a reverse slice, we do the same thing, only using as a start column the end of the query,
            i.e. 17 in this example, compared to the firstName part of the index slots.  bsearch will give us the
            first slot where firstName > start ([20..25] here), so we subtract an extra one to get the slot just before.
