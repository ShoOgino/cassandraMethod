         * will at times try to log to System.out/err when it has issues.
         *
         * Now here is the problem. There is a deadlock if a thread logs to System.out, blocks on the async
         * appender queue, and the async appender thread tries to log to System.out directly as part of some
         * internal logback issue.
         *
         * So to prevent this we have to exhaustively check before locking in the PrintStream and forward
         * to real System.out/err if it is the async appender
