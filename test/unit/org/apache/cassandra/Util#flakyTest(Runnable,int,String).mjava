     * Wrapper function used to run a test that can sometimes flake for uncontrollable reasons.
     *
     * If the given test fails on the first run, it is executed the given number of times again, expecting all secondary
     * runs to succeed. If they do, the failure is understood as a flake and the test is treated as passing.
     *
     * Do not use this if the test is deterministic and its success is not influenced by external factors (such as time,
     * selection of random seed, network failures, etc.). If the test can be made independent of such factors, it is
     * probably preferable to do so rather than use this method.
     *
     * @param test The test to run.
     * @param rerunsOnFailure How many times to re-run it if it fails. All reruns must pass.
     * @param message Message to send to System.err on initial failure.
