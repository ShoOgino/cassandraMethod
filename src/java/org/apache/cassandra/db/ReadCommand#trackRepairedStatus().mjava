     * repaired datasets. In this context, an sstable is considered repaired if it is marked
     * repaired or has a pending repair session which has been committed.
     * In addition to the digest, a set of ids for any pending but as yet uncommitted repair sessions
     * is recorded and returned to the coordinator. This is to help reduce false positives caused
     * by compaction lagging which can leave sstables from committed sessions in the pending state
     * for a time.
