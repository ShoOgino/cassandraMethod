    /**
     * For the legacy layout deserializer, we have to deal with the fact that a row can span multiple index blocks and that
     * the call to hasNext() reads the next element upfront. We must take that into account when we check in AbstractSSTableIterator if
     * we're past the end of an index block boundary as that check expect to account for only consumed data (that is, if hasNext has
     * been called and made us cross an index boundary but neither readNext() or skipNext() as yet been called, we shouldn't consider
     * the index block boundary crossed yet).
     *
     * TODO: we don't care about this for the current file format because a row can never span multiple index blocks (further, hasNext()
     * only just basically read 2 bytes from disk in that case). So once we drop backward compatibility with pre-3.0 sstable, we should
     * remove this.
