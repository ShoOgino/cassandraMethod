             the serializer type. The 3rd bit indicates if compression
             is turned on or off. It is turned off by default. The 4th
             bit indicates if we are in streaming mode. It is turned off
             by default. The 5th bit is used to indicate that the sender
             is not listening on any well defined port. This implies the 
             receiver needs to cache the connection using the port on the 
             socket. The following 3 bits are reserved for future use. 
             The next 8 bits indicate a version number. Remaining 15 bits 
             are not used currently.
