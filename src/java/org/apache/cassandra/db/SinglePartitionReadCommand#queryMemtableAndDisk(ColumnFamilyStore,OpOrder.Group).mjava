     *   1) does not check the row cache.
     *   2) does not apply the query limit, nor the row filter (and so ignore 2ndary indexes).
     *      Those are applied in {@link ReadCommand#executeLocally}.
     *   3) does not record some of the read metrics (latency, scanned cells histograms) nor
     *      throws TombstoneOverwhelmingException.
     * It is publicly exposed because there is a few places where that is exactly what we want,
     * but it should be used only where you know you don't need thoses things.
     * <p>
     * Also note that one must have "started" a {@code OpOrder.Group} on the queried table, and that is
     * to enforce that that it is required as parameter, even though it's not explicitlly used by the method.
