    /**
     * Liveness information for the primary key columns of this row.
     * <p>
     * As a row is uniquely identified by its primary key, all its primary key columns
     * share the same {@code LivenessInfo}. This liveness information is what allows us
     * to distinguish between a dead row (it has no live cells and its primary key liveness
     * info has no timestamp) and a live row but where all non PK columns are null (it has no
     * live cells, but its primary key liveness has a timestamp). Please note that the ttl
     * (and local deletion time) of the PK liveness information only apply to the
     * liveness info timestamp, and not to the content of the row. Also note that because
     * in practice there is not way to only delete the primary key columns (without deleting
     * the row itself), the returned {@code LivenessInfo} can only have a local deletion time
     * if it has a TTL.
     * <p>
     * Lastly, note that it is possible for a row to have live cells but no PK liveness
     * info timestamp, because said timestamp is only set on {@code INSERT} (which makes sense
     * in itself, see #6782) but live cells can be add through {@code UPDATE} even if the row
     * wasn't pre-existing (which users are encouraged not to do, but we can't validate).
