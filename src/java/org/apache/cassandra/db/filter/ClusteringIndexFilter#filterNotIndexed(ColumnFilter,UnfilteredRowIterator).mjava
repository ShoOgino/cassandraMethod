     * This method is the "dumb" counterpart to {@link #getSlices(CFMetaData)} in that it has no way to quickly get
     * to what is actually selected, so it simply iterate over it all and filters out what shouldn't be returned. This should
     * be avoided in general.
     * Another difference with {@link #getSlices(CFMetaData)} is that this method also filter the queried
     * columns in the returned result, while the former assumes that the provided iterator has already done it.
     *
     * @param columnFilter the columns to include in the rows of the result iterator.
     * @param iterator the iterator for which we should filter rows.
     *
     * @return an iterator that only returns the rows (or rather Unfilted) from {@code iterator} that are selected by this filter.
