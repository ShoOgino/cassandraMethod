     * Return a function which performs post processing on the results of a partition range read command.
     * In future, this may be used as a generalized mechanism for transforming results on the coordinator prior
     * to returning them to the caller.
     *
     * This is used on the coordinator during execution of a range command to perform post
     * processing of merged results obtained from the necessary replicas. This is the only way in which results are
     * transformed in this way but this may change over time as usage is generalized.
     * See CASSANDRA-8717 for further discussion.
     *
     * The function takes a PartitionIterator of the results from the replicas which has already been collated
     * & reconciled, along with the command being executed. It returns another PartitionIterator containing the results
     * of the transformation (which may be the same as the input if the transformation is a no-op).
