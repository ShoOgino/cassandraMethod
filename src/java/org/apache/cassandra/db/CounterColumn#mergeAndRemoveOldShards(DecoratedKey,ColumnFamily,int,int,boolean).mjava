    /**
     * There is two phase to the removal of old shards.
     * First phase: we merge the old shard value to the current shard and
     * 'nulify' the old one. We then send the counter context with the old
     * shard nulified to all other replica.
     * Second phase: once an old shard has been nulified for longer than
     * gc_grace (to be sure all other replica had been aware of the merge), we
     * simply remove that old shard from the context (it's value is 0).
     * This method does both phases.
     * (Note that the sendToOtherReplica flag is here only to facilitate
     * testing. It should be true in real code so use the method above
     * preferably)
