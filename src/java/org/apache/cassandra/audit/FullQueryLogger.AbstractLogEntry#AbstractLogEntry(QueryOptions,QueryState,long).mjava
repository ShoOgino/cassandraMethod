             * query options into binary format.
             *
             * I went with the lowest risk most predictable option which is allocator overhead and CPU overhead
             * rather then keep the original query message around so I could just serialize that as a memcpy. It's more
             * instructions when turned on, but it doesn't change memory footprint quite as much and it's more pay for what you use
             * in terms of query volume. The CPU overhead is spread out across producers so we should at least get
             * some scaling.
